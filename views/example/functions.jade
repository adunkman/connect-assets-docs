  h2 Function Scope

  p By default, connect-assets exposes its helper functions in the <code>global</code> scope.

  p If youâ€™re feeling particularly responsible (or would like to include two copies of connect-assets without them interfering with each other) you can change the scope:

  != highlight('var app = require("express")();\n\nrequire("connect-assets")({\n  helperContext: app.locals\n});')
